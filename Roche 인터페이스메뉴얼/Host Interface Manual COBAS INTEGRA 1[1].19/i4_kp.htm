<font face="Arial"><b>Order date with&nbsp; Error ORA-01840</b></font>
<font face="Arial"><b>in Integra 400 V 2.3</b></font><br>
<font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This &nbsp;problem appeared after
updating from version 2.2 to version 2.3.</font><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Reason for the problem:</span></font><br>
<font face="Arial"> </font>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">When an order entry (block 10) is sent by the
host, the date can be defined in line 53 (Order ID). However, if the
transmitted date is different from the actual date, no time stamp is
added. When the system attempts to write this "shortened" date/time
into the Oracle database (V 7.3), this leads to a failure with
ORA-01840 Error (input value not long enough for date format).</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Possible workarounds:&nbsp;</span></font>
<ul>
  <font face="Arial"> </font>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">The host transmission should be modified so
that
it never uses a date different from the actual date. Because this is
difficult to guarantee, especially around the date changes, the
recommended solution is to use the date format 00/00/0000 as described
in the HIF manual. This ensures that a consistent time stamp is always
generated.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <font face="Arial">This problem does not exist in V 3.3 (XP version,
because the Oracle version (9.3) can handle the date stamp without
errors</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Checksum<br>
</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Contrary to the I700, the checksum, on
outgoing blocks, is filled with 0's instead of spaces when &lt; 100.
The Integra 400 accepts both forms. Because the host has normally to
convert the incoming checksum string to an integer, this not an issue
in most cases.<br>
This problem is corrected in V 2.2<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">ASCII characters with a code over 128 (example
    <font size="5"><b>&micro;</b></font>)&nbsp; cannot be used, as they
generate a wrong checksum.&nbsp;<br>
This may appear, for example, if the operator forces such a character
to be used, when programming a custom unit&nbsp; for a test. This unit
will be transmitted to the host together with the result and will upset
the checksum calculation.<br>
This problem is corrected in V 2.2</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Sample types</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">A fundamental difference between INTEGRA
400/400 Plus and INTEGRA 700/800 is that a sample type field <b>always</b>
exists in the instrument database and cannot be disabled.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">
    <p align="justify">As soon as the sample racks are inserted into
the instrument, the Order Number <u>AND</u> the Sample Type have to be
available to the instrument's database. Otherwise the samples are
handled as unknown and can not be queried by the host. There are two
practical ways to provide the Sample Type:</p>
    <p align="justify">1.) Using of Sample Type defined racks</p>
    <p align="justify">2.) Using bar codes providing the Sample Type</p>
    <p align="justify">The transmission of the Sample Type Information
to the LIS computer, however, is independent and can be switched off.
If bar codes are used for Order Number and Sample Type, please note
that
those are sent in different data fields and <u>NOT</u> sent in one
string.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>C</b><b>ollated results</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>Due to instrument performance reasons and
in order to have results on the Host system available as soon as
possible,&nbsp; we strongly recommend <font color="#ff0000">NOT using
"Collated Results" requests</font> ( i.e., not using Result Type
Selector 03, 04, 05 and 06 ).<br>
    </b></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">In some cases the preparation of collated
results may&nbsp; take several minutes and by far exceed the normal
recommended timeout of 180 seconds.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Ratios will <b>not</b> be collated with other
results, as they have automatically a different sample type.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Collated results selector 04 transmits also
blocked and invalid test results together with valid ones. Although
they are clearly flagged as such, this may become an issue if the host
does not properly handle result flags.<br>
