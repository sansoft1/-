    to have results on the Host system available as soon as possible,&nbsp; we
    strongly recommend <font color="#ff0000">NOT using &quot;Collated
    Results&quot; requests</font> ( i.e., not using Result Type Selector 03, 04,
    05 and 06 ).<br>
    </b></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Ratios will <b>not</b> be collated with other results,
    as they have automatically a different sample type.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Collated results selector 04 transmits also blocked and
    invalid test results together with valid ones. Although they are clearly
    flagged as such, this may become an issue if the host does not properly
    handle result flags.</font></li>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Block type 10 having no tests (no line code 55 present)
    have been reported to hang the host interface on the INTEGRA 700.&nbsp;<br>
    This behavior could not be reproduced and probably happens at random. <br>
    This situation is triggered by an unsupported configuration of the order
    entry block an should be avoided from the host side.</font></li>
