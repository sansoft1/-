<ul>
  <li><font FACE="Arial"><b>Due to instrument performance reasons and in order
    to have results on the Host system available as soon as possible,&nbsp; we
    strongly recommend <font color="#ff0000">NOT using &quot;Collated
    Results&quot; requests</font> ( i.e., not using Result Type Selector 03, 04,
    05 and 06 ).<br>
    </b></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Ratios will <b>not</b> be collated with other results,
    as they have automatically a different sample type.<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Collated results selector 04 transmits also blocked and
    invalid test results together with valid ones. Although they are clearly
    flagged as such, this may become an issue if the host does not properly
    handle result flags.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><b>Empty orders</b></font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Block type 10 having no tests (no line code 55 present)
    have been reported to hang the host interface on the INTEGRA 800.&nbsp;<br>
    This behavior could not be reproduced and probably happens at random. This
    situation is triggered by an unsupported configuration of the order entry
    block an should be avoided from the host side. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><a name="Timing">Timing</a> and priority of order entry.</b></font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">The automatic handling of RD 5 racks in the INTEGRA 800
    creates a special situation regarding Host interface information flow:&nbsp;<br>
    New inserted RD 5 racks remain only for a limited time on the
    instrument.&nbsp;see <a href="i8_setup.htm#Wflow"><b>Workflow
    adaptation&nbsp;</b></a></font>
    <p><font face="Arial">The first priority should always be the acquisition of
    new results </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">When lists of &quot;tubes without orders&quot; are
    returned from the instrument, uploading of the <b>order entries has to be
    given priority over patient entries</b>. <br>
    If patient entries are given a higher priority, over orders,&nbsp; this may
    lead to the situation where some racks time out, before receiving orders and
    are therefore ejected on the output tray without tests performed.<br>
